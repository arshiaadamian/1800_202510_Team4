# Project Name

JAC Web Application

## Overview

This client-side JavaScript web application provides like-minded gamers a way to connect with each other through our matching algorithm. It filters gamers based on their gaming preferences and populates a suggested friends page with gamers just like them. They can also share interests within user created communities and message one and another through our real-time messaging system. 

Developed for the [COMP 1800] course, applying User-Centred Design practices, agile methodology processes, and Firebase backend services.

## Limitations and Future Work

### Limitations

- Currently, the app only supports email contacting as well as through the messaging system in the web application. 
- Limited to basic sharing in communities (just words). Cannot upload pictures, reply to a post, or use emojis. No thumbs up or down.
- The Events page is limited to just the front-end, does not have a functionality. 
- UI can be enhanced. 
- User needs to input profile updates otherwise the email will not have a messaging template. 
- Currently filters friends through five different gaming preferences. 

### Future Work


- Add more choices to filter the gamers. Instead of only 5 choices, perhaps 5 choices of 3 different categories. 
- Implement additional events functionality that can bookmark and save events to users own Events page. 
- Create a settings page where users can change their background colour. 
- Integrate user accounts to display more information, (age, country, description about themselves).
